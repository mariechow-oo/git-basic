What is the difference between "add", "commit", and "push"?

They are different commands needed to update remote repository when local changes are made.
- add -> add files with changes in the working directory of current local branch to the staging area for commits to be made
- commit -> capture staged changes and records it as a new revision with a log for the current local branch
- push -> upload the commited changes from local to respective remote branch on the remote repository
